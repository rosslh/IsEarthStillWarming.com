              In late 2015, 184 nations were party to the Paris Climate Accord,
              a UN agreement dealing with reducing greenhouse gas emissions in
              an effort to mitigate global warming. The stated goal of the

              In 2018, the UN released a report detailing the potential impacts
              of human-induced climate change and possible preventative
              measures. Its key finding was that staying below the 1.5°C target

            <p>
              Global warming will impact a wide range of issues including
              health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security,
              and economic growth.
              <Cite name="1.5C" /> The severity of these impacts is determined
              by how hot Earth gets; reaching 2°C above the pre-industrial
              average would put millions more people at risk than if global
              warming was limited to 1.5°C.

              countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are

              The UN projects more frequent weather extremes (both heavy rain
              and drought) and temperature extremes due to global warming.
              <Cite name="1.5C" /> The most immediate risk to the environment is
              the dying-off of coral reefs- a process that has already started
              on a large scale (see fig. 3).

              The changing climate is likely to increase the prevalence of
              disease. Global increases in temperature are estimated to alter
              the distribution of insects that are known vectors for pathogens,
              such as mosquitos.
              <Cite name="pathogenMigration" /> Studies in China show that
              increasing temperatures positively affect the viability of disease
              transfer by decreasing the viral incubation time in vectors --
              leading to increased infection rates.
              <Cite name="viralIncubation" />
              The World Health Organization estimated that climate change has
              been responsible for 3% of diarrhoea, 3% of malaria, and 3.8% of
              dengue fever deaths worldwide in 2004. Total attributable
              mortality was about 0.2% of deaths in 2004; of these, 85% were
              child deaths.

              Global biodiversity comes under major threat from climate change
              as changing environments increase extinction pressure on species.
              A review in 2013 reveals that changing environments may lead to
              the extinction of thousands of species within the next 100 years.
              The proximate causes of such extinctions include biotic and
              abiotic factors, such as limited physiological tolerance to high
              temperatures and changing species interactions.

              Other already-visible impacts of global warming include worldwide
              glacier and sea ice melting, which contributes to sea level rise.
              <Cite name="natGeo" /> However, thermal expansion is a larger
              component in this, contributing 70-75% of sea level rise.
